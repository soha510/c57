 There lived a crocodile and his wife...
 one day crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. the kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits.
  the crocodile came back the next day for more fruits. 

  The warm, lilac fragrance with a hint of rose enveloped me in a graceful hug as I strolled through the stone tiled walkway adorned in my laced, baby pink tutu. The streets of Tokyo were overflowing with people in a wide range of clothing; from the traditional Japanese kimonos to a simple coat or jacket. The magnificent cherry blossoms bloomed overhead like a thick, light pink canopy. Finally reaching the polished wooden stage, I slipped on my pointe shoes and joined the other dancers backstage, mentally preparing myself to face the eager audience.
